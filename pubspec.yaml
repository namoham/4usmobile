# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:

  assets:
    - data/4us.db
    - images/4us.png
    - images/logo.png
    - images/cooperative_argan.png
    - images/beneficiaries.png
    - images/demandefinancement.png
    - images/agenda.png
    - images/reporting.png
    - images/duration.png
    - images/rate.png
    - images/investment.png
    - images/contribution.png
    - images/selling.png
    - images/funding.png
    - images/profit.png
    - images/period.png
    - images/calculation.jpeg
    - assets/lang/


    #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

    # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Raleway
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Raleway-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: fonts/Raleway-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: fonts/Raleway-LightItalic.ttf
          weight: 300
          style: italic
        - asset: fonts/Raleway-MediumItalic.ttf
          weight: 400
          style: italic
        - asset: fonts/Raleway-Italic.ttf
          weight: 400
          style: italic
    - family: Roboto
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf
